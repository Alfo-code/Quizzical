# Quizzical
This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).<br/>
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- Build a quiz app using React
- Make 2 screens (start & questions)
- Fetch questions from the OTDB API
- Tally correct answers after 'check answers' is clicked
- Styled & polished (according to the Figma design file)
- Add a 'try again' button
  
## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS framework
- npm - Vite
- Figma design files from Scrimba
- The questions were pulled from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/)

## Future improvements

- [ ] Code refactor: DRY   
- [ ] Ability to choose: number of questions, difficulty level & genre
